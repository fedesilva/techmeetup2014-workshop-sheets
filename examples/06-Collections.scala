    |Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    |Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
    |While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    |As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    |''Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door-
    |Only this, and nothing more.'
    |
    |Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
    |And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    |Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow
    |From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-
    |For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
    |Nameless here for evermore.
